<!--Atom: I figured out how to create a new file and get it on the same hierarchy level as the other two files that are in HTML-Personal Site folder. It takes a few more steps.
In the project window, I left
 clicked on the HTML-Personal Site folder to select it.  Then I went to the top of the screen Menu and left clicked on File.  I then left clicked on New File and in Atom a window opened
 named untitled. Next, I left clicked on  Save As and this opened a Save File dialog box. I opened the HTML-Personal Site folder that was in the dialog box so the new file
 would be on the same hierarchy level as the two other files. I
 gave the new file a name and saved it.  I still would like to know what caused the problem I first mentioned in my previous post today.-->
